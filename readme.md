# Mend
Mend is a language based on Scratch, with influence from Lua
<br>
Yeah, that's it

<br>

### Current language version: 1.2
#### ""The 'Functions Work Now' Update"(Standardized Edition)"
**Changelog**
* (not sure) Mend now has a standard library!(from 'mendfiles', to import indiviual files by doing `import "stdlib/[FILE]"` or to import the entire library do `import "stdlib"`)

* (new feature) The `import` keyword can now be used to import entire files, however non .Mend files are ignored

* (new feature) Added 'statelabels', marked with a '@'; the only statelabels currently are `@builtin` and `@ignorewarning`

* (backend, bugfix) `record_until_endtoken` now works correctly

* (kinda both a change and a fix?) Functions can now take in other functions for their arguments
