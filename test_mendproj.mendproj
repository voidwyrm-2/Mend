/*
A friend was also making a language at the time of writing,
and for they're file importing they had a .oroproj file with the project settings and all the files that are needed
So this is an example of what it might look like if I decide to do it

// first the project name, this is the name of the entire Mend project
name: "Example Mend Project"

// then the project version
projversion: "1.0.0"

// then the version of the language used for the project
// this will probably be useless...
langversion: "1.0" // most recent version as of writing

// then the required files/modules
this will be a list of a bunch of paths or something, Idk
required: [
    "stdlib", // you can optionally choose not to include the standard library if you don't want to
    "../MyCoolMendLibrary"
